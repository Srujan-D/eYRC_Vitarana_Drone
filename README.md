Our submission for the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2020-21 for theme vitarana drone. The eYRC is jointly hosted by IIT Bombay and Government of India. Our theme (Vitarana Drone) involved developing autonomous path planning algorithms for a 3-D simulated quadcopter capable of package delivery in a cityscape environment simulated in Gazebo.

We used the following concepts to develop our solution:

1. Control systems (PID building).
2. Path planning & obstacle avoidance using the bug2 algorithm.
3. Image processing for marker detection.
4. Scheduling of the parcels to be delivered and returned.

Tools used:

1. Robot Operating System (ROS)
2. Gazebo simulator
3. Python and its libraries

You can check out our solution's demo here: [link][demo-link]
